Headline: NYC Elementary School Students Had Less Arts Instruction During the Pandemic
<br>
<br>
For this assignment, I'm looking at data related to arts instruction in New York City public schools. The main question I want to answer is how arts instruction changed during the pandemic, or how it has changed over time. I compared a dataset from the <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2019-2020-Arts-Report/datr-f3ru">2019-2020</a> school year to the most recent non-pandemic school year I could find, <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2016-2017-Arts-Report/tybm-5xnx">2016-2017</a>. I compared the percentage of elementary schools in each district in the city that had classes all four arts disciplines that NYC public schools offer (music, visual art, dance, theater). The data shows that most school districts saw a decrease in the percentage of schools that offer all four arts disciplines. I plan to reach out to DOE to see if there is a dataset available from 2018-2019, so I can see if the change from 2016-17 to 2019-20 is potentially correlted to COVID, or if that's a separate pattern across NYC schools. This data is from the DOE and is compiled as part of the <a href=https://infohub.nyced.org/reports/academics/annual-arts-in-schools-reports"> Annual Arts in Schools report.</a>

<h1>Troubling trends in depression among Latino youth in New York City</h1>
<h3>by Sarah Kerson</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/overview.htm">CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Survey</a> monitors health behaviors that contribute to causes of death, disability and social problems in the United States. Data collected over 10 years from 1999-2019 show that depression, defined as feeling "so sad or hopeless almost every day for 2 weeks or more in a row that they stopped doing some usual activities," is on the rise among high school aged Latino youth in New York City, and is higher among Latino youth than those of other races. (Note that there was no data on this point for the year 2005.) That survey also showed that depression rates among Latino youth in the city were the highest on Staten Island at 45%. This data supports <a href="https://salud-america.org/healthy-minds-research/">findings from Salud America</a> in 2017 that found Latino youth are more likely to have mental health issues than their peers. That report cites limited access to mental health care, as well as community issues like discrimination, poverty and immigration as those that impact mental health among young Latinos in the United States. Salud America's <a href="https://salud-america.org/mental-health-research-policy-implications/">conclusions</a> suggest culturally competent mental health care, including bilingual services and a comprehensive understanding of how immigration issues affect mental health, could help young Latinos struggling with their mental health.
